# vs-restart
Visual Studio 2013 Restart extension, download it [here](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/01f0a1ae-1513-48dd-9cf0-efb38419b480)

This extension tries to simplify the process of restarting visual studio, it also allows you to restart with elevated permissions (usefull for example when starting to debug attached to IIS).

By pressing Restart Elevated command inside the File menu, visual studio will be restarted with admin rights and the current solution/project will be reopened (even command line switch will be restored).

**Note**

Restarting while running Visual Studio as Administrator would cause VS to restart elevated. 
Feel free to comment or report any issue.

**VS2015** support was made by a community member, based on this extension. Try it out [here](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/b4ced461-1e51-4d2b-bf6a-9144a7da16a2)
